				<p class="paragraph">The descendants of woolly mammoths and mastodons, elephants are considered to be a keystone species in their habitat. Found in both Africa and Asia, there are currently only three species: the African elephant, the African forest elephant, and the Asian elephant. Like humans, elephants are "eusocial," meaning their herds consist of multiple generations of elephants. The males leave the group at adulthood and live alone or with other males. Elephants are poached for their ivory tusks, leading them to be on many endangered species lists. Elephants are highly intelligent, and are said to have a great memory of locations where food and water are present, even after not having visited them for years.</p>
